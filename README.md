# Camagru
## The project Camagru is a project from 42'school, in the Web branch

First project of 42's web branch. I had to create a website with some contraints
like PHP in server side and whatever in front size, it was my first real web
project.

In this project, you have to create an account system with a possibility
for connected user to take/upload pictures and edit it.

You must have the possibility to like/comment and dislike/uncomment pictures,
which has the effect to send email to picture's user.
